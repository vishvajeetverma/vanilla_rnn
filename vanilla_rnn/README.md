# Vanilla RNN from Scratch for Vehicle Sensor Data

This project implements a vanilla Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) from scratch using only NumPy to process vehicle sensor data.

## Features

- Vanilla RNN implementation from scratch (no deep learning frameworks)
- Time series prediction on vehicle sensor data
- Backpropagation Through Time (BPTT)
- Gradient clipping to prevent exploding gradients

## Dataset

Place your vehicle sensor dataset in this directory. Supported formats: CSV, Excel.

## Setup

1. Install required packages:
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

2. Update the dataset path in the notebook and run the cells.

## Structure

- `vanilla_rnn.ipynb` - Main notebook with RNN implementation and training
