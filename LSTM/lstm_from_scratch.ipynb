        "## About This Project\n",
        "\n",
        "This LSTM implementation is part of a larger project focused on predictive maintenance for vehicles using OBD-II data. This work builds upon the Vanilla RNN implementation in this repository, which serves as the foundation for understanding recurrent neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Research Background\n",
        "\n",
        "This implementation is based on the methodology described in the research paper: [DeepAR + STAM + VAE for predictive maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.17654). While the full system will eventually combine DeepAR, STAM, and VAE components, this LSTM implementation serves as a critical building block, as LSTM is the basis for both DeepAR and STAM architectures.\n"
